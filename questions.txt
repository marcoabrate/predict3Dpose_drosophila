Since we want to remove 5 of the 7 cameras, wouldn't be difficult to train the network
to estimate 2d pose since we don't have the correction anymore?
Is the solution to use pre-trained weights and release the software without the
possibility to train on other datasets? Isn't there a mechanisms that trains the network
while running (during prediction)? Isn't this affected when using just 2 cameras?

STACKED HOURGLASS:
Since we want to remove 5 of the 7 cameras, wouldn't be difficult to train the network
to estimate 2d pose since we don't have the correction anymore?
Is the solution to use pre-trained weights and release the software without the
possibility to train on other datasets? Isn't there a mechanisms that trains the network
while running (during prediction)? Isn't this affected when using just 2 cameras?

CAMERAS PARAMS:
R: 3x3 Camera rotation matrix
T: 3x1 Camera translation parameters
f: (scalar) Camera focal length
c: 2x1 Camera center
k: 3x1 Camera radial distortion coefficients
p: 2x1 Camera tangential distortion coefficients

3D DATA:

general coordinates:
dictionary of 150 keys
(n samples, 96)

camera coordinates:
dictionary of 150*N_CAMS keys (600 in our case)
poses: (n samples, 96)

postprocess:
> train_set = poses - np.tile( poses[:,:3], [1, len(H36M_NAMES)] )
		    ^we subtract the root positions every 3 columns
> train_root_positions: (n samples, 3)

complete train_set:
(1559752, 96)

normalization:
data mean (on complete train_set)
data std deviation (on complete train_Set)
> dimensions_to_use: (48,)
> dimensions_to_ignore (48,)
  ^they contain numbers from 0 to 95 (which is the dimension of the complete train_set
  ^of course, the dimensions in dimensions_to_use are not in dimensions_to_ignore and vice versa

normalization:
!!! here we work ONLY with the dimensions_to_use
subtract mean and divide by standard deviation (calculated on the dimensions_to_use)
return a dictionary (of 600 keys) made of data[:, dimensions_to_use]

3D data dimension: dictionary of 600 (150*N_CAMS) keys, values are (n samples, 48)

2D DATA:

reading stacked hourglass prediction:
> poses: (n samples, 16, 2) reshape> (n samples, 32)
> dim_to_use: (32,)
> poses_final = np.zeros((n samples, 64))
  poses_final[dim_to_use] = poses
return a dictionary (of 600 keys) made of poses_final

complete train_set:
(1559752, 64)

normalization:
data mean (on complete train_set)
data std deviation (on complete train_Set)
> dimensions_to_use: (32,)
> dimensions_to_ignore (32,)
  ^they contain numbers from 0 to 64 (which is the dimension of the complete train_set
  ^of course, the dimensions in dimensions_to_use are not in dimensions_to_ignore and vice versa

normalization:
!!! here we work ONLY with the dimensions_to_use
subtract mean and divide by standard deviation (calculated on the dimensions_to_use)
return a dictionary (of 600 keys) made of data[:, dimensions_to_use]

DATA NORMALIZATION:
since we remove the root positions (first 3 numbers) from every entry, mean and standard deviation are ZERO for those entries. In the 3d estimation baseline they ignore these 3 dimensions for training. Should i do the same? When we apply normalization, we encounter NaN

DIMENSIONS TO USE:
3d: [ 1  2  3  6  7  8 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 25 26 27]
2d: [ 0  1  2  3  6  7  8 12 13 15 17 18 19 25 26 27]
